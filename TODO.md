# TODO

## Things yet to accomplish

1. Add device specific items for Cameras (someone send me a camera)
2. Add device specific items for Cellular Gateway, update device discovery
3. Add device specific items for Switches
4. Eliminate SNMP and go to Meraki Cloud for interface stats (hmmmm?)

If you want to add to this list please [file it as a bug]
